# Use-the-Force-Luke-
This program documents the path of a proton beam by backtracking from the exhaust port backwards
through a room to a spot on the wall that needs to be hit.

## Assumptions: 
Assume that the user will only enter the proper type of data. Assume that The exhaust port will always
be on the west (left) or the north (top) wall, and NEVER at a corner. Assume that the mirrors will always be oriented
as a '\' or a '/'. Assume that that the walls of the room are represented by the character ‘x’, the exhaust port is represented
by ‘*’, and the empty spaces are represented by ‘.'.
